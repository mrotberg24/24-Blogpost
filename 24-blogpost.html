        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Ever wondered how four simple numbers can combine to form a puzzle that’s both deceptively straightforward and deeply intriguing? 
            Welcome to the game of <span class="math">24</span>—a challenge where you take four given numbers and, using only addition, subtraction, 
            multiplication, and division (plus the clever use of parentheses), try to hit exactly <span class="math">24</span>.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            At first glance, the rules are simple. However, as you experiment with different combinations, you’ll discover that the game hides layers of strategy 
            and creativity. Not only does it serve as a fun brain teaser, but it also sharpens your number sense and opens the door to exploring combinatorial 
            reasoning in everyday arithmetic.<sup>[2]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this blogpost, we’ll dive into the magic behind the 24 Game, exploring its fascinating mathematical underpinnings, discussing common strategies, 
            and even challenging you with puzzles to solve on your own. Let’s embark on this journey and uncover how simple numbers can create big puzzles!

    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            In the 24 Game, you’re given four numbers—often between 1 and 9—and the goal is to combine them (using <span class="math">+, –, ×, ÷</span> 
            and parentheses) to reach exactly <span class="math">24</span>. Every number must be used exactly once, and the order and grouping can drastically 
            change the outcome.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>
        <figure>
            <!-- Update the src attribute with the correct relative path to your image -->
            <img src="24-game_example.png" alt="24 Game card with numbers 2, 3, 6, and 4"
                 style="max-width: 200px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
            <figcaption>An example 24 Game card featuring the numbers 2, 3, 6, and 4.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Consider the card above. One possible solution for these numbers is:
            <span class="math">((6 ÷ 2) × 4) + 3 = 24</span>.
            Notice how we used all four numbers <em>once</em> and arranged them with parentheses to reach 24.<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            This mix of simple arithmetic and creative thinking is what makes the 24 Game so addictive. Even if you’re comfortable with basic operations, 
            the puzzle can catch you off guard, forcing you to rethink how numbers can be combined.
        </p>

    <!-- The Math Behind the Game Section -->
    <section id="the-math-behind">
        <h2>The Math Behind the Game</h2>
        <p>
            The beauty of the 24 Game goes beyond a simple arithmetic challenge—it’s also a celebration of basic combinatorics.
            Consider that when you have four distinct numbers, there are exactly 
            <span class="math">4! = 24</span> different ways to arrange them. This isn’t a coincidence: the target number itself echoes the number of possible orderings!<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            But it doesn’t stop there. When you introduce the four basic operations (<span class="math">+, – , ×, ÷</span>) along with the possibility of using parentheses, 
            the number of distinct expressions you can form increases dramatically. Even a small set of numbers can yield hundreds—or even thousands—of unique ways to reach 24.
        </p>
        <p>
            This explosion of possibilities offers a playful glimpse into combinatorial thinking. It shows how simple rules can generate a vast landscape of outcomes, 
            and it reinforces the idea that a solid number sense is essential for flexible arithmetic problem solving.<sup>[2]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In essence, the 24 Game is a practical way to see combinatorics in action. It reminds us that sometimes, the answer is hidden in the very structure of the problem itself—
            in this case, the number 24 encapsulates the richness of all possible arrangements of four elements.

    <!-- A Puzzle For You Section -->
    <section id="puzzle">
        <h2>A Puzzle For You</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you’ve seen how the 24 Game works and the fascinating math behind it, it’s time for a challenge! Can you solve the following puzzle on your own?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Numbers:</strong> <span class="math">1, 3, 4, 6</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Combine these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with appropriate parentheses) to reach <span class="math">24</span>. 
            Remember, each number must be used exactly once.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Hint:</em> Think about forming a fraction that, when subtracted from 1, gives a small number that you can then use to multiply up to 24.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The 24 Game is more than just a fun puzzle—it’s a window into the beauty of arithmetic and combinatorial thinking.
            By exploring how simple numbers can combine in creative ways, we uncover surprising relationships and strategies that sharpen our problem-solving skills.<sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you’re playing for fun or to boost your mathematical intuition, every round of 24 challenges you to see beyond routine calculations 
            and appreciate the art hidden in everyday arithmetic.
        </p>
